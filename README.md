# Refined Open Set Domain Adaptation
Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) addresses the challenge of knowledge transfer under both data and label shifts. However, conventional OSDA algorithms treat all private samples as a single "unknown" class, leading to feature entanglement among distinct private classes and hindering refined classification. In this work, we introduce Refined Open Set Domain Adaptation (ROSDA), which aims to classify common samples while assigning refined labels to target private samples from  distinct classes (e.g., unknown 1, ..., unknown $r$). To tackle this challenge, we propose a Wisely Leveraging Singular Values-based Clustering (LASER) framework for ROSDA. Specifically, we determine the number of target private classes based on the singular values of the similarity matrix, followed by clustering the private samples. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the similarity matrix provides a more accurate representation of the cluster structure compared to the original feature space. LASER incorporates a multi-granularity feature alignment mechanism and a robust pseudo-labeling strategy driven by optimal similarity, both of which collaboratively enhance classification accuracy and feature discriminability. Extensive experiments conducted on five time series classification benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of LASER.
